      "Reduced strain on social services",
      "Decreased tax base and potential decline in services",
      "Higher birth rates"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanations": [
      "Incorrect. The loss of young adults is more likely to hinder economic development.",
      "Incorrect. An aging population may place more, not less, strain on social services.",
      "Correct. A smaller, older population leads to a reduced tax base, which can lead to a decline in public services.",
      "Incorrect. A population concentrated in the older age groups would typically lead to lower birth rates."

    "stimulus": "The population of Manhattan is approximately 1.6 million people, and its land area is 22.82 square miles.",
    "question": "What is the population density of Manhattan?",
    "answers": [
      "About 500 people per square mile",
      "About 7,000 people per square mile",
      "About 16,000 people per square mile",
      "About 70,000 people per square mile"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 3,
    "explanations": [
      "Incorrect. Calculation of population density involves dividing population by area, which is much larger than 500.",
      "Incorrect. Calculation of population density involves dividing population by area, which is much larger than 7,000.",
      "Incorrect. Calculation of population density involves dividing population by area, which is much larger than 16,000.",
      "Correct. Population density is calculated as population divided by area: 1,600,000 people / 22.82 sq mi = ~70,114 people per square mile"

    "answers": [
      "High agricultural density",
      "Low agricultural density",
      "High physiological density",
      "Low arithmetic density"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanations": [
      "Incorrect. High agricultural density requires a large number of farmers relative to arable land.",
      "Correct. Low agricultural density is indicated by a small number of farmers per unit of arable land.",
      "Incorrect. Physiological density relates to the total population size per unit of arable land, not specifically farmers.",
      "Incorrect. Arithmetic density is total population divided by total land area."

    "stimulus": "A population pyramid shows relatively equal numbers of people in each age group, but with a slightly smaller base.",
    "question": "What does this population pyramid shape suggest about this country's demographic situation?",

      "Rapid Population Decline",
      "Rapid Population Growth",
      "Slow Population Growth",
      "Stable Population"

    "correct_answer": 3,
    "explanations": [
      "Incorrect. Rapid Population Decline would be defined by a much smaller base.",
      "Incorrect. Rapid Population Growth would be defined by a much larger base.",
      "Incorrect. While a Stable Population exhibits slow growth, it would not be characterized by a slightly smaller base.",

    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanations": [
      "Incorrect. To be Rapidly Growing, this population would have a higher TFR and greater Natural Increase.",
      "Correct. While the TFR and CBR/CDR alone do not necessarily indicate rapid growth, this country is Growing based on positive Natural Increase.",
      "Incorrect. To be Stable, the Birth and Death rates must be equal to one another, or the TFR would need to be lower.",
      "Incorrect. A Declining Population would be indicated by a negative Natural Increase."
